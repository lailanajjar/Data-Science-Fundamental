# Project_1 (Sales Prediction Project)
## Introduction : 
This project focuses on predicting sales prices for various products across different retail outlets. The goal is to analyze and model the factors that influence sales, such as product characteristics, outlet features, and pricing. By leveraging data visualization and machine learning techniques, we aim to build a predictive model that accurately forecasts sales, helping businesses optimize their pricing strategies and inventory management.
 
### Project Objectives:
1. **Data Exploration**: Analyze the dataset to understand the distribution of sales across products and outlets.
2. **Data Visualization**: Create exploratory visuals, including histograms, boxplots, countplots, and heatmaps, to uncover patterns and correlations within the data.
3. **Modeling**: Develop predictive models to estimate sales prices based on the available features.
4. **Evaluation**: Assess the model's performance using appropriate metrics to ensure accurate predictions.
 
### Key Insights:
- **Highest Sales at the Oldest Outlet**: One of the oldest stores, in terms of construction year, shows the highest sales,however the other shows the lowest sales  while other stores, despite differences in construction years, exhibit relatively similar sales.

- - **Sales according to Outlit type**: Obviuously Groceries have the least sales which explains the Sales gap between the oldest stores among the other outlits

- **Strong Correlation**: A moderate positive correlation was found between the product's MRP (Maximum Retail Price) and its sales, indicating that higher-priced products tend to generate more sales.
 
This project showcases the process of understanding and predicting sales using a combination
